# Object-Oriented-Programming
 Object oriented design. Encapsulation and information hiding. Implementation and behavior separation. Classes and subclasses. Inheritance: overriding, dynamic dispatch. Polymorphism: relation between subtype polymorphism and inheritance. Class hierarchy. Learning goals: 1) Justify the philosophy of object-oriented design and the concepts of encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism; 2) Design, implement, test, and debug simple programs in an object-oriented programming language; 3) Describe how the class mechanism supports encapsulation and information hiding; 4) Design, implement, and test the implementation of “is-a” relationships among objects using a class hierarchy and inheritance; 5) Compare and contrast the notions of overloading and overriding methods in an objectoriented language.
